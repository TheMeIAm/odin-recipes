        <h2>For garlic lovers everywhere!</h2>
        <p> Prepare an extra head (or two!) of roasted garlic.
            Its soft caramelized cloves are simply irresistible 
            spread on bread as an accompaniment to this soup.
            Better yet, pop whole roasted cloves straight into 
            the bowls before filling with soup.</p>
        <H3>Ingredients</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head of garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablepoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>5 leeks - using white and light green parts only - 
                sliced in half lengthwise, cleaned, and 
                sliced thinly</li>
            <li>4-5 large white onions, diced large</li>
            <li>6 zucchini, diced large</li>
            <li>2 quarts (8 cups) water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176F. Peel and rinse garlic 
                and place cloves on a piece of aluminum foil.
                Drizzle olive oil over the garlic and seal the foil. 
                Place sealed garlic in baking pan, to avoid leaking, 
                and roast for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>While garlic is roasting, put 2 tablespoons
                olive oil in a big pot over medium heat.
                Add leeks and onions; saute until golden brown.
                Browning longer will create a deeper flavor.</li>
            <li>Add zucchini to the pot. Add water and salt.
                Bring to a boil and cover. Reduce heat and
                simmer on low for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool.
                Put cloves in soup. Transfer soup to blender
                and puree until smooth, or use an immersion blender
                 directly into the pot. Serve hot.</li>
