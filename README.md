This website will be a holiday menu website with some of my favorite recipes for the holidays. 

It will include
 a main menu page, 
 a table of contents for each kind of recipe, 
 and a new page for each recipe.

The goal of this project is to practice what I have learned about Github and commits, HTML, and website construction.
I will also spend more time becoming comfortable with the Linux terminal and Visual Studio.

Ultimately I would like this website to be an attractive and useful reflection of my new skills.
